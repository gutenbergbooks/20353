<h2><a name="FATHER_WILLIAM" id="FATHER_WILLIAM"></a>FATHER WILLIAM</h2>

<p>
<img src="images/capy.png" width="67" height="55" class="floatl" alt="Y" title="Y" />OU are old, father William,&quot; the young man said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And your hair has become very white:</span><br />
And yet you incessantly stand on your head&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do you think, at your age, it is right?&quot;</span><br />
<br />
&quot;In my youth,&quot; father William replied to his son,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I feared it might injure the brain:</span><br />
But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why, I do it again and again.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;as I mentioned before,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And have grown most uncommonly fat;</span><br />
Yet you turned a back somersault in at the door&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pray, what is the reason of that?&quot;</span><br />
<br />
&quot;In my youth,&quot; said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I kept all my limbs very supple</span><br />
By the use of this ointment&#8212;one shilling the box&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Allow me to sell you a couple.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;and your jaws are too weak<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For anything tougher than suet;</span><br />
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pray, how did you manage to do it?&quot;</span><br />
<br />
&quot;In my youth,&quot; said his father, &quot;I took to the law,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And argued each case with my wife:</span><br />
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has lasted the rest of my life.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth; &quot;one would hardly suppose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That your eye was as steady as ever;</span><br />
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What made you so awfully clever?&quot;</span><br />
<br />
&quot;I have answered three questions, and that is enough,&quot;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said his father; &quot;don't give yourself airs!</span><br />
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!&quot;</span><br />

<h2><a name="THE_WALRUS_AND_THE_CARPENTER" id="THE_WALRUS_AND_THE_CARPENTER"></a>THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER</h2>

<p>
<img src="images/capt.png" width="47" height="55" class="floatl" alt="T" title="T" />HE sun was shining on the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shining with all his might:</span><br />
He did his very best to make<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The billows smooth and bright&#8212;</span><br />
And this was odd, because it was<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The middle of the night.</span><br />
<br />
The moon was shining sulkily,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because she thought the sun</span><br />
Had got no business to be there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">After the day was done&#8212;</span><br />
&quot;It's very rude of him,&quot; she said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;To come and spoil the fun!&quot;</span><br />
<br />
The sea was wet as wet could be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sands were dry as dry.</span><br />
You could not see a cloud, because<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No cloud was in the sky:</span><br />
No birds were flying overhead&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There were no birds to fly.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>The Walrus and the Carpenter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were walking close at hand:</span><br />
They wept like anything to see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such quantities of sand:</span><br />
&quot;If this were only cleared away,&quot;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They said, &quot;it would be grand!&quot;</span><br />
<br />
&quot;If seven maids with seven mops<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swept it for half a year,</span><br />
Do you suppose,&quot; the Walrus said<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;That they could get it clear!&quot;</span><br />
&quot;I doubt it,&quot; said the Carpenter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shed a bitter tear.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;O Oysters come and walk with us!&quot;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Walrus did beseech.</span><br />
&quot;A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along the briny beach:</span><br />
We cannot do with more than four,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To give a hand to each.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But never a word he said:</span><br />
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shook his heavy head&#8212;</span><br />
Meaning to say he did not choose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To leave the oyster-bed.</span><br />
<br />
But four young oysters hurried up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All eager for the treat:</span><br />
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their shoes were clean and neat&#8212;</span><br />
And this was odd, because, you know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They hadn't any feet.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Four other oysters followed them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet another four;</span><br />
And thick and fast they came at last,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And more, and more, and more&#8212;</span><br />
All hopping through the frothy waves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scrambling to the shore.</span><br />
<br />
The Walrus and the Carpenter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Walked on a mile or so,</span><br />
And then they rested on a rock<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Conveniently low:</span><br />
And all the little Oysters stood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And waited in a row.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;The time has come,&quot; the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;To talk of many things;</span><br />
Of shoes&#8212;and ships&#8212;and sealing-wax&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of cabbages&#8212;and kings&#8212;</span><br />
And why the sea is boiling hot&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And whether pigs have wings.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
&quot;But wait a bit,&quot; the Oysters cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Before we have our chat:</span><br />
For some of us are out of breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all of us are fat!&quot;</span><br />
&quot;No hurry!&quot; said the Carpenter.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They thanked him much for that.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>&quot;A loaf of bread,&quot; the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Is what we chiefly need:</span><br />
Pepper and vinegar besides<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are very good indeed&#8212;</span><br />
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We can begin to feed.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
&quot;But not on us!&quot; the Oysters cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turning a little blue.</span><br />
&quot;After such kindness that would be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dismal thing to do!&quot;</span><br />
&quot;The night is fine,&quot; the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Do you admire the view?&quot;</span><br />
<br />
&quot;It was so kind of you to come!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And you are very nice!&quot;</span><br />
The Carpenter said nothing but<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Cut us another slice:</span><br />
I wish you were not quite so deaf&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've had to ask you twice!&quot;</span><br />
<br />
&quot;It seems a shame,&quot; the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;To play them such a trick,</span><br />
After we've brought them out so far,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made them trot so quick!&quot;</span><br />
The Carpenter said nothing but<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The butter's spread too thick!&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>&quot;I weep for you,&quot; the Walrus said:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I deeply sympathize.&quot;</span><br />
With sobs and tears he sorted out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those of the largest size,</span><br />
Holding his pocket-handkerchief<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before his streaming eyes.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;O Oysters,&quot; said the Carpenter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;You've had a pleasant run!</span><br />
Shall we be trotting home again?&quot;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But answer came there none&#8212;</span><br />
And this was scarcely odd, because<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They'd eaten every one.</span><br />

<h2><a name="THE_HUNTING_OF_THE_SNARK_Extracts" id="THE_HUNTING_OF_THE_SNARK_Extracts"></a>THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK&#8212;Extracts</h2>

<p>
<img src="images/capc.png" width="70" height="55" class="floatl" alt="C" title="C" />OME, listen, my men, while I tell you again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The five unmistakable marks</span><br />
By which you may know, wheresoever you go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The warranted genuine Snarks.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:</span><br />
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With a flavour of Will-o-the-wisp.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;Its habit of getting up late you'll agree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That it carries too far, when I say</span><br />
That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And dines on the following day.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which it constantly carries about,</span><br />
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A sentiment open to doubt.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;The fifth is ambition. It next will be right<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To describe each particular batch:</span><br />
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From those that have whiskers, and scratch.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>&quot;For although common Snarks do no manner of harm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet I feel it my duty to say</span><br />
Some are Boojums&#8212;&quot; The Bellman broke off in alarm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For the Baker had fainted away.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 5em;">* * * * * *</span></p>
<p>
They roused him with muffins&#8212;they roused him with ice&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They roused him with mustard and cress&#8212;</span><br />
They roused him with jam and judicious advice&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They set him conundrums to guess.</span><br />
<br />
When at length he sat up and was able to speak,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His sad story he offered to tell;</span><br />
And the Bellman cried &quot;Silence! Not even a shriek!&quot;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And excitedly tingled his bell.</span><br />
<br />
There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Scarcely even a howl or a groan,</span><br />
As the man they called &quot;Ho!&quot; told his story of woe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In an antediluvian tone.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;My father and mother were honest, though poor&#8212;&quot;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Skip all that!&quot; cried the Bellman in haste,</span><br />
&quot;If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We have hardly a minute to waste!&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>&quot;I skip forty years,&quot; said the Baker, in tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And proceed without further remark</span><br />
To the day when you took me aboard of your ship<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To help you in hunting the Snark.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Remarked, when I bade him farewell&#8212;&quot;</span><br />
&quot;Oh, skip your dear uncle,&quot; the Bellman exclaimed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As he angrily tingled his bell.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;He remarked to me then,&quot; said the mildest of men,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right;</span><br />
Fetch it home by all means&#8212;you may serve it with greens<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And it's handy for striking a light.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;'You may seek it with thimbles&#8212;and seek it with care;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You may hunt it with forks and hope;</span><br />
You may threaten its life with a railway-share;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You may charm it with smiles and soap&#8212;</span><br />
<br />
&quot;'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If your Snark be a Boojum! For then</span><br />
You will softly and suddenly vanish away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And never be met with again!'</span><br />

&quot;It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When I think of my uncle's last words:</span><br />
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Brimming over with quivering curds!</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Bellman indignantly said.</span><br />
And the Baker replied &quot;Let me say it once more.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It is this, it is this that I dread!</span><br />
<br />
&quot;I engage with the Snark&#8212;every night after dark&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In a dreamy delirious fight:</span><br />
I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I use it for striking a light:</span><br />
<br />
&quot;But if ever I met with a Boojum, that day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In a moment (of this I am sure),</span><br />
I shall softly and suddenly vanish away&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the notion I cannot endure!&quot;</span><br />

<p><span style="margin-left: 5em;">* * * * * *</span></p>
<p>
The Bellman looked uffish and wrinkled his brow.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;If only you'd spoken before!</span><br />
It's excessively awkward to mention it now,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!</span><br />
<br />
&quot;We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If you never were met with again&#8212;</span><br />
But surely, my man, when the voyage began,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You might have suggested it then?</span><br />
<br />
&quot;It's excessively awkward to mention it now&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As I think I've already remarked.&quot;</span><br />
And the man they called &quot;Hi!&quot; replied, with a sigh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;I informed you the day we embarked.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>&quot;You may charge me with murder&#8212;or want of sense&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(We are all of us weak at times)</span><br />
But the slightest approach to a false pretence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was never among my crimes!</span><br />
<br />
&quot;I said it in Hebrew&#8212;I said it in Dutch&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I said it in German and Greek:</span><br />
But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That English is what you speak!&quot;</span><br />

<h2><a name="GENTLE_ALICE_BROWN" id="GENTLE_ALICE_BROWN"></a>GENTLE ALICE BROWN</h2>


<p>
<img src="images/capi.png" width="45" height="55" class="floatl" alt="I" title="I" />T was a robber's daughter, and her name was Alice Brown,<br />
Her father was the terror of a small Italian town;<br />
Her mother was a foolish, weak, but amiable old thing;<br />
But it isn't of her parents that I'm going for to sing.<br />
<br />
As Alice was a-sitting at her window-sill one day<br />
A beautiful young gentleman he chanced to pass that way;<br />
She cast her eyes upon him, and he looked so good and true,<br />
That she thought, &quot;I could be happy with a gentleman like you!&quot;<br />
<br />
And every morning passed her house that cream of gentlemen,<br />
She knew she might expect him at a quarter unto ten,<br />
A sorter in the Custom-house, it was his daily road<br />
(The Custom-house was fifteen minutes' walk from her abode).<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>But Alice was a pious girl, who knew it wasn't wise<br />
To look at strange young sorters with expressive purple eyes;<br />
So she sought the village priest to whom her family confessed&#8212;<br />
The priest by whom their little sins were carefully assessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, holy father,&quot; Alice said, &quot;'twould grieve you, would it not?<br />
To discover that I was a most disreputable lot!<br />
Of all unhappy sinners I'm the most unhappy one!&quot;<br />
The padre said, &quot;Whatever have you been and gone and done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have helped mamma to steal a little kiddy from its dad,<br />
I've assisted dear papa in cutting up a little lad.<br />
I've planned a little burglary and forged a little cheque,<br />
And slain a little baby for the coral on its neck!&quot;<br />
<br />
The worthy pastor heaved a sigh, and dropped a silent tear&#8212;<br />
And said, &quot;You mustn't judge yourself too heavily, my dear&#8212;<br />
It's wrong to murder babies, little corals for to fleece;<br />
But sins like these one expiates at half-a-crown apiece.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls will be girls&#8212;you're very young and flighty in your mind;<br />
Old heads upon young shoulders we must not expect to find;<br />
We mustn't be too hard upon these little girlish tricks&#8212;<br />
Let's see&#8212;five crimes at half-a-crown&#8212;exactly twelve-and-six.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>&quot;Oh, father,&quot; little Alice cried, &quot;your kindness makes me weep,<br />
You do these little things for me so singularly cheap&#8212;<br />
Your thoughtful liberality I never can forget;<br />
But, oh, there is another crime I haven't mentioned yet!<br />
<br />
&quot;A pleasant-looking gentleman, with pretty purple eyes&#8212;<br />
I've noticed at my window as I've sat a-catching flies;<br />
He passes by it every day as certain as can be&#8212;<br />
I blush to say I've winked at him, and he has winked at me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For shame,&quot; said Father Paul, &quot;my erring daughter! On my word<br />
This is the most distressing news that I have ever heard.<br />
Why, naughty girl, your excellent papa has pledged your hand<br />
To a promising young robber, the lieutenant of his band!<br />
<br />
&quot;This dreadful piece of news will pain your worthy parents so!<br />
They are the most remunerative customers I know;<br />
For many, many years they've kept starvation from my doors,<br />
I never knew so criminal a family as yours!<br />
<br />
&quot;The common country folk in this insipid neighborhood<br />
Have nothing to confess, they're so ridiculously good;<br />
And if you marry any one respectable at all,<br />
Why, you'll reform, and what will then become of Father Paul?&quot;<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>The worthy priest, he up and drew his cowl upon his crown,<br />
And started off in haste to tell the news to Robber Brown;<br />
To tell him how his daughter, who was now for marriage fit,<br />
Had winked upon a sorter, who reciprocated it.<br />
<br />
Good Robber Brown he muffled up his anger pretty well,<br />
He said, &quot;I have a notion, and that notion I will tell;<br />
I will nab this gay young sorter, terrify him into fits,<br />
And get my gentle wife to chop him into little bits.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've studied human nature, and I know a thing or two;<br />
Though a girl may fondly love a living gent, as many do,<br />
A feeling of disgust upon her senses there will fall<br />
When she looks upon his body chopped particularly small.&quot;<br />
<br />
He traced that gallant sorter to a still suburban square;<br />
He watched his opportunity and seized him unaware;<br />
He took a life-preserver and he hit him on the head,<br />
And Mrs. Brown dissected him before she went to bed.<br />
<br />
And pretty little Alice grew more settled in her mind,<br />
She never more was guilty of a weakness of the kind,<br />
Until at length good Robber Brown bestowed her pretty hand<br />
On the promising young robber, the lieutenant of his band.<br />

<h3>A Derby Legend</h3>


<p>
<img src="images/cape.png" width="48" height="55" class="floatl" alt="E" title="E" />MILY JANE was a nursery maid&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">James was a bold Life Guard,</span><br />
And John was constable, poorly paid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And I am a doggerel bard).</span><br />
<br />
A very good girl was Emily Jane,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Jimmy was good and true,</span><br />
And John was a very good man in the main<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And I am a good man, too).</span><br />
<br />
Rivals for Emmie were Johnny and James,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though Emily liked them both;</span><br />
She couldn't tell which had the strongest claims<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And I couldn't take my oath).</span><br />
<br />
But sooner or later you're certain to find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your sentiments can't lie hid&#8212;</span><br />
Jane thought it was time that she made up her mind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And I think it was time she did).</span><br />
<br />
Said Jane, with a smirk and a blush on her face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I'll promise to wed the boy</span><br />
Who takes me to-morrow to Epsom Race!&quot;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Which I would have done, with joy).</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>From Johnny escaped an expression of pain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Jimmy said, &quot;Done with you!</span><br />
I'll take you with pleasure, my Emily Jane!&quot;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And I would have said so too).</span><br />
<br />
Johnny lay on the ground, and he roared like mad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(For Johnny was sore perplexed),</span><br />
And he kicked very hard at a very small lad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Which I often do, when vexed).</span><br />
<br />
For John was on duty next day with the Force,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To punish all Epsom crimes;</span><br />
Some people will cross when they're clearing the course<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(I do it myself, sometimes).</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">* * * * * *</span><br />
<br />
The Derby Day sun glittered gaily on cads,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On maidens with gamboge hair,</span><br />
On sharpers and pickpockets, swindlers and pads<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(For I, with my harp, was there).</span><br />
<br />
And Jimmy went down with his Jane that day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And John by the collar or nape</span><br />
Seized everybody who came in his way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And I had a narrow escape).</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>He noticed his Emily Jane with Jim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And envied the well made elf;</span><br />
And people remarked that he muttered &quot;Oh, dim!&quot;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(I often say &quot;dim!&quot; myself).</span><br />
<br />
John dogged them all day, without asking their leaves;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For his sergeant he told, aside,</span><br />
That Jimmy and Jane were notorious thieves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And I think he was justified).</span><br />
<br />
But James wouldn't dream of abstracting a fork,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Jenny would blush with shame</span><br />
At stealing so much as a bottle or cork<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(A bottle I think fair game).</span><br />
<br />
But, ah! there's another more serious crime!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They wickedly strayed upon</span><br />
The course, at a critical moment of time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(I pointed them out to John).</span><br />
<br />
The crusher came down on the pair in a crack&#8212;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then, with a demon smile,</span><br />
Let Jenny cross over, but sent Jimmy back<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(I played on my harp the while).</span><br />
<br />
Stern Johnny their agony loud derides<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a very triumphant sneer&#8212;</span><br />
They weep and they wail from the opposite sides<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And I shed a silent tear).</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>And Jenny is crying away like mad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Jimmy is swearing hard;</span><br />
And Johnny is looking uncommonly glad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And I am a doggerel bard).</span><br />
<br />
But Jimmy he ventured on crossing again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The scenes of our Isthmian Games&#8212;</span><br />
John caught him and collared him, giving him pain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(I felt very much for James).</span><br />
<br />
John led him away with a victor's hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Jimmy was shortly seen</span><br />
In the station-house under the grand Grand Stand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(As many a time I've been).</span><br />
<br />
And Jimmy, bad boy, was imprisoned for life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though Emily pleaded hard;</span><br />
And Johnny had Emily Jane to wife<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And I am a doggerel bard).</span><br />

<p>
<img src="images/capm.png" width="48" height="55" class="floatl" alt="M" title="M" />ACPHAIRSON CLONGLOCKETTY ANGUS M'CLAN<br />
Was the son of an elderly laboring man,<br />
You've guessed him a Scotchman, shrewd reader, at sight,<br />
And p'raps altogether, shrewd reader, you're right.<br />
<br />
From the bonnie blue Forth to the hills of Deeside,<br />
Round by Dingwall and Wrath to the mouth of the Clyde,<br />
There wasn't a child or woman or man<br />
Who could pipe with Clonglocketty Angus M'Clan.<br />
<br />
No other could wake such detestable groans,<br />
With reed and with chanter&#8212;with bag and with drones:<br />
All day and all night he delighted the chiels<br />
With sniggering pibrochs and jiggety reels.<br />
<br />
He'd clamber a mountain and squat on the ground,<br />
And the neighboring maidens would gather around<br />
To list to his pipes and to gaze in his een,<br />
Especially Ellen M'Jones Aberdeen.<br />
<br />
All loved their M'Clan, save a Sassenach brute,<br />
Who came to the Highlands to fish and to shoot!<br />
He dressed himself up in a Highlander way,<br />
Though his name it was Pattison Corby Torbay.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Torbay had incurred a good deal of expense<br />
To make him a Scotchman in every sense:<br />
But this is a matter, you'll readily own,<br />
That isn't a question of tailors alone.<br />
<br />
A Sassenach chief may be bonily built,<br />
He may purchase a sporran, a bonnet, and kilt;<br />
Stick a skean in his hose&#8212;wear an acre of stripes&#8212;<br />
But he cannot assume an affection for pipes.<br />
<br />
Clonglocketty's pipings all night and all day<br />
Quite frenzied poor Pattison Corby Torbay;<br />
The girls were amused at his singular spleen,<br />
Especially Ellen M'Jones Aberdeen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Macphairson Clonglocketty Angus, my lad,<br />
With pibrochs and reels you are driving me mad;<br />
If you really must play on that cursed affair,<br />
My goodness! play something resembling an air.&quot;<br />
<br />
Boiled over the blood of Macphairson M'Clan&#8212;<br />
The clan of Clonglocketty rose as one man;<br />
For all were enraged at the insult, I ween&#8212;<br />
Especially Ellen M'Jones Aberdeen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's show,&quot; said M'Clan, &quot;to this Sassenach loon<br />
That the bagpipes can play him a regular tune.<br />
Let's see,&quot; said M'Clan, as he thoughtfully sat,<br />
&quot;'In My Cottage' is easy&#8212;I'll practice at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>He blew at his &quot;Cottage,&quot; and blew with a will,<br />
For a year, seven months, and a fortnight until<br />
(You'll hardly believe it) M'Clan, I declare,<br />
Elicited something resembling an air.<br />
<br />
It was wild&#8212;it was fitful&#8212;as wild as the breeze&#8212;<br />
It wandered about into several keys;<br />
It was jerky, spasmodic, and harsh, I'm aware,<br />
But still it distinctly suggested an air.<br />
<br />
The Sassenach screamed and the Sassenach danced,<br />
He shrieked in his agony&#8212;bellowed and pranced;<br />
And the maidens who gathered rejoiced at the scene,<br />
Especially Ellen M'Jones Aberdeen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hech gather, hech gather, hech gather around;<br />
And fill a' yer lugs wi' the exquisite sound,<br />
An air frae the bagpipes&#8212;beat that if ye can!<br />
Hurrah for Clonglocketty Angus M'Clan!&quot;<br />
<br />
The fame of his piping spread over the land;<br />
Respectable widows proposed for his hand,<br />
And maidens came flocking to sit on the green&#8212;<br />
Especially Ellen M'Jones Aberdeen.<br />
<br />
One morning the fidgety Sassenach swore<br />
He'd stand it no longer&#8212;he drew his claymore,<br />
And (this was, I think, in extremely bad taste),<br />
Divided Clonglocketty close to the waist.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>Oh! loud were the wailings for Angus M'Clan&#8212;<br />
Oh! deep was the grief for that excellent man&#8212;<br />
The maids stood aghast at the horrible scene,<br />
Especially Ellen M'Jones Aberdeen.<br />
<br />
It sorrowed poor Pattison Corby Torbay<br />
To find them &quot;take on&quot; in this serious way.<br />
He pitied the poor little fluttering birds,<br />
And solaced their souls with the following words:&#8212;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, maidens,&quot; said Pattison, touching his hat,<br />
&quot;Don't snivel, my dears, for a fellow like that;<br />
Observe, I'm a very superior man,<br />
A much better fellow than Angus M'Clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
They smiled when he winked and addressed them as &quot;dears,&quot;<br />
And they all of them vowed, as they dried up their tears,<br />
A pleasanter gentleman never was seen&#8212;<br />
Especially Ellen M'Jones Aberdeen.<br />

<p>
<img src="images/capa.png" width="48" height="55" class="floatl" alt="A" title="A" /> RAVEN sat upon a tree,<br />
And not a word he spoke, for<br />
His beak contained a bit of Brie,<br />
Or, maybe, it was Roquefort:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We'll make it any kind you please,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At all events, it was a cheese.</span><br />
<br />
Beneath the tree's umbrageous limb<br />
A hungry fox sat smiling;<br />
He saw the raven watching him,<br />
And spoke in words beguiling.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;<i>J'admire</i>,&quot; said he &quot;<i>ton beau plumage</i>,&quot;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(The which was simply persiflage.)</span><br />
<br />
Two things there are, no doubt you know,<br />
To which a fox is used;<br />
A rooster that is bound to crow,<br />
A crow that's bound to roost,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And whichsoever he espies</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He tells the most unblushing lies.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>&quot;Sweet fowl,&quot; he said, &quot;I understand<br />
You're more than merely natty,<br />
I hear you sing to beat the band<br />
And Adelina Patti.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pray render with your liquid tongue</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A bit from 'G&#246;tterd&#228;mmerung.'&quot;</span><br />
<br />
This subtle speech was aimed to please<br />
The crow, and it succeeded:<br />
He thought no bird in all the trees<br />
Could sing as well as he did.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In flattery completely doused</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He gave the &quot;Jewel Song&quot; from &quot;Faust.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
But gravitation's law, of course,<br />
As Isaac Newton showed it,<br />
Exerted on the cheese its force.<br />
And elsewhere soon bestowed it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In fact, there is no need to tell</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What happened when to earth it fell.</span><br />
<br />
I wish to add that when the bird<br />
Took in the situation<br />
He said one brief, emphatic word,<br />
Unfit for publication.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fox was greatly startled, but</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He only sighed and answered &quot;Tut.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
The Moral is: A fox is bound<br />
To be a shameless sinner.<br />
And also: When the cheese comes round<br />
You know it's after dinner.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But (what is only known to few)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fox is after dinner, too.</span><br />

<img src="images/capm.png" width="48" height="55" class="floatl" alt="M" title="M" />OST worthy of praise were the virtuous ways<br />

And no one was ever more cautious and clever<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than Little Red Riding Hood's pa.</span><br />
They never misled, for they meant what they said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And frequently said what they meant:</span><br />
They were careful to show her the way she should go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the way that they showed her, she went.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For obedience she was effusively thanked,</span><br />

<br />
It thus isn't strange that Red Riding Hood's range<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of virtues so steadily grew,</span><br />
That soon she won prizes of different sizes,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At twelve wrote a volume of verse,</span><br />
At fourteen was yearning for glory, and learning<br />

To a glorious height the young paragon might<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have climbed, if not nipped in the bud,</span><br />
But the following year struck her smiling career<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a dull and a sickening thud!</span><br />

<br />
Not dreaming of harm, one day on her arm<br />

With a whitening cheek she started to speak,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But her peril she instantly saw:</span><br />
Her grandma had fled and she'd tackled instead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Four merciless paws and a maw!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When the neighbors came running the wolf to subdue</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He was licking his chops&#8212;and Red Riding Hood's, too!</span><br />

And yet it was better, I fear, he should get her:&#8212;<br />

For an infant so keen might in future have been<br />

<p>
<img src="images/capa.png" width="48" height="55" class="floatl" alt="A" title="A" /> CAPITAL ship for an ocean trip,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was the &quot;Walloping Window-blind&quot;;</span><br />
No gale that blew dismayed her crew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or troubled the captain's mind.</span><br />
The man at the wheel was taught to feel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Contempt for the wildest blow,</span><br />
And it often appeared, when the weather had cleared,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That he'd been in his bunk below.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;The boatswain's mate was very sedate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet fond of amusement, too;</span><br />
And he played hop-scotch with the starboard watch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the captain tickled the crew.</span><br />
And the gunner we had was apparently mad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he sat on the after rail,</span><br />
And fired salutes with the captain's boots,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the teeth of the booming gale.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>&quot;The captain sat in a commodore's hat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dined in a royal way</span><br />
On toasted pigs and pickles and figs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gummery bread each day.</span><br />
But the cook was Dutch and behaved as such;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the diet he gave the crew</span><br />
Was a number of tons of hot-cross buns<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Prepared with sugar and glue.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;All nautical pride we laid aside,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we cast the vessel ashore</span><br />
On the Gulliby Isles, where the Poohpooh smiles,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Rumbletumbunders roar.</span><br />
And we sat on the edge of a sandy ledge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shot at the whistling bee;</span><br />
And the cinnamon-bats wore water-proof hats<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As they danced in the sounding sea.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;On rubgub bark, from dawn to dark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We fed, till we all had grown</span><br />
Uncommonly shrunk,&#8212;when a Chinese junk<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came by from the torriby zone.</span><br />
She was stubby and square, but we didn't much care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we cheerily put to sea;</span><br />
And we left the crew of the junk to chew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bark of the rubgub tree.&quot;</span><br />

&quot;A snake is as round as a hole in the ground,<br />
